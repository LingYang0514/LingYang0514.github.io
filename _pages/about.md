### About
- I am a Ph.D. student in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Hong Kong, focusing on `microfluidics` and `soft matter` research. 

### Research 
- My work involves studying complex flow phenomena in nature and life, understanding their mechanisms, and leveraging this knowledge to manipulate liquids for applications in bioanalysis, heat transfer, energy, and the environment.

### Interests
- I am particularly fascinated by `biomimetic engineering`, exploring how plants and animals interact with their environments and employ strategies for survival in extreme conditions. 

- My interests extend to topics such as `soft robotics`, `hydrogels`, `structural color`, `additive manufacture`, `origami`, and `kirigami`.
