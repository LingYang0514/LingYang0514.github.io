In this Review, we discuss how the bionic introduction of reentrant feature on a surface mediates fluid wetting, contact line motion, as well as solid adhesion. We briefly introduce nature-inspired design principles from representative reentrant surfaces on the springtail, gecko, and pitcher plant. Through quantitatively associating microscopic structural parameters of reentrant feature, including angle, shape, diameter, thickness, sharpness and anisotropy, with macroscopically visible wetting and adhesion properties, we evaluate how the design of reentrant feature can enable exceptional ",

As a special outcome of droplet impact, the bouncing of droplets keeps the form of the droplets after the impact and minimizes the energy loss during the impact, being beneficial in many applications. A unified understanding of droplet bouncing is in high demand for effective development of new techniques to serve applications. This review shows the fundamentals, regulations, and applications of millimeter‚Äêsized droplet bouncing on solid surfaces and same/miscible liquids (liquid pool and another droplet). Regulation methods and current applications are summarized, and potential directions are proposed.",
